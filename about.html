<h2>About Us </h2>
<p>Caseys Custom Woodworking was originally started in a garage producing projects as a hobby. Making benches and small wall art soon lead to a complete different direction. Once asked to make a flag, Casey found a new pride in wordwork. Building flags was his way of showing his support to those who sacrificed their lives for us daily. Now Caseys Custom has grown to so much more with the ability to make custom pieces and fill orders with minimum turn around time. </p>

<h3> Mission Statement </h3>
<p>Our products are not mass-produced but each is one of a kind. Each project is built using only the finest quality materials and techniques that are meant to last a lifetime. </p>
